This fork was made to prepare app to work on repo build system

Actually it is not fully working in a repo (require vlc compilation),
but can help to include VLC in the AOSP system image.

So, to compile libvlc jni library :

export ANDROID_NDK=/<your NDK path>
export ANDROID_SDK=/<your SDK path>

then Execute :

  ./install.sh

finally, execute "mm" or include VLC package to the device.mk

-------------------------------------------------------------

For the installable VLC-debug.apk :

you need ant 1.8 and Android SDK (android-sdk-linux_x86)

  aptitude install ant ant-optional

For the repo system apk (without jni lib), just type "mm"
